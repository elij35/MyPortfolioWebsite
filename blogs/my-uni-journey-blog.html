            </header>

            <div class="blog-content">
                <p class="blog-intro">As I sip my (probably too strong) coffee and stare at the mountain of coursework
                    on my desk, it hits me—I'm about to enter my final year studying Computer Science with a focus on
                    Cyber Security at Plymouth University. How did we get here so fast?</p>

                <h2>The Cybersecurity Bug Bit Hard</h2>
                <p>I remember my first cybersecurity lecture like it was yesterday. The professor was demonstrating how
                    easily an unsecured network could be compromised, and something just clicked in my brain. That
                    moment of "Wait, you can actually <em>do</em> that?" turned into a full-blown obsession.</p>

                <p>Fast forward to today, and I'm lucky enough to be working with the Southwest Cyber Resilience Centre.
                    If you'd told first-year-me that I'd soon be delivering security training to actual businesses, I'd
                    have laughed nervously while secretly hoping you were right.</p>

                <h2>When Theory Meets Reality</h2>
                <p>There's nothing quite like the feeling when classroom concepts suddenly make sense in the real world.
                    Like the time I was explaining phishing techniques to a local charity:</p>

                <blockquote class="blog-quote">
                    "See that email that looks like it's from your bank? That's not your bank. No, really—hover over the
                    link. I'll wait."
                </blockquote>

                <p>The lightbulb moments I witness during these sessions are just as rewarding for me as they are for
                    the attendees. Plus, it's surprisingly fun to be the "hey, did you know..." person at parties
                    (though my friends might disagree).</p>

                <h2>Juggling Acts and Life Lessons</h2>
                <p>Between lectures, my cybersecurity work, and my photography job at Warwick Castle, I've
                    become something of a time management wizard. My calendar looks like a rainbow explosion of
                    colour-coded obligations, but somehow it all gets done.</p>

                <p>The real surprise? Discovering that the most valuable skills aren't always the technical ones. Who
                    knew that explaining buffer overflows to my grandma would become such good practice for simplifying
                    complex concepts?</p>

                <h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>
                <p>Over the past few years, I've developed what I affectionately call my "digital Swiss Army knife":</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nessus:</strong> My go-to for vulnerability scanning</li>
                    <li><strong>Kali Linux:</strong> The ultimate playground for security testing</li>
                    <li><strong>Burp Suite:</strong> For when I need to poke at web applications</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each tool has its own learning curve (and associated frustration), but mastering them has been
                    incredibly rewarding.</p>

                <h2>Beyond the Screen</h2>
                <p>When I'm not staring at lines of code or security logs, you'll probably find me:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Out walking or cycling in the countryside</li>
                    <li>Building custom PCs that light up like Christmas trees</li>
                    <li>Attempting to explain cybersecurity concepts to my very patient cat</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
                <p>As graduation looms on the horizon, I'm equal parts excited and terrified. The cybersecurity field
                    changes faster than I can keep up with sometimes, but that's part of what makes it so thrilling.</p>

                <p>Whether it's diving deeper into digital forensics or exploring malware analysis, I'm ready for
                    whatever challenges come next. Well, mostly ready. After I finish this coffee, at least.</p>
